## 1. Variables, Data Types & Classes

### 1.1 Variables

- Variables **must** be initiliased before utilisation

```java
int i; // declared
i = 10; // initialised (assigned)

int j = 10; // in one step

int x, y, z = 10; // in one line
```

### 1.2 Enums

#### Key Notes:

- Enum is a special type (similar to a class) to denote a group of constants and is denoted with uppercase starting letter
- Enums can have fields, methods, constructors, nested classes, interfaces and enums like other classes
- Type safe so you can only assign enum values to variables of the same enum type
- Enums are immutable, cannot add or remove values once created (implicitly `public`, `static` and `final`)
- Cannot instantiate new enums, instances are created when the enum is loaded
- Enums inherit methods from the `java.lang.Enum` class
- Java also provides several built in enums (e.g `java.time.Month`)

#### Example:

```java
public enum Day {
  MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY;
}
```

#### Fields, Methods & Constructors in Enums

- Fields in Enums can store additional information about each constant
- Enum constructors are used to initialise these values
- Enum constructors are implicitly `private` and cannot take on any other access modifier
- Enum constructors are called once per constant
- Enums can have instance and static methods to be called on the constants or the enum itself
- For instance members, `this` refers to the current constant

E.g:

```java
public enum Fruit {
  // constants use the Fruit constructor
  APPLE("Red"),
  BANANA("Yellow");

  public final String color; // stores color of fruit constant

  Fruit(String color) {
    this.color = color;
  }
}

Fruit fruit = Fruit.APPLE;
fruit.color; // returns "Red"
```

#### Advanced Enums

- Enums can implement interfaces much like classes
- Enums can also have its own abstract methods
- Each enum constant must provide its own custom implementation of all the abstract methods from their source

##### Example:

```java
public enum Operation {
  // if using a constructor, just utilise the syntax as normal to initiliase the instance fields
  ADD {
    @Override
    public int apply(int x, int y) {
      return x + y;
    }
  },
  SUBTRACT {
    @Override
    public int apply(int x, int y) {
      return x - y;
    }
  }

  public abstract int apply(int x, int y);
}
```

### 1.3 Primitive Types

#### Key Points:

- All primitive types passed by value

#### Integer Types:

```java
byte b = 12; // 1 byte
short s = 236; // 2 bytes
int i = 153; // 4 bytes
long l = 100L; // 8 bytes
```

- int and long default to int, specify L to declare as long

#### Float Types:

```java
float f = 100.23f; // 4 bytes
double d = 100.23; // 8 bytes
```

- float and double default to double, specify f to declare as float

#### Non-numeric Types:

```java
boolean b = true; // 1 bit
char c = 'c'; // 2 bytes (\u0000 to \uFFFF so UTF-16)
```

### 1.4 Reference Types (Objects)

#### Key Points:

- All reference types passed by reference

#### Strings:

```java
String s = "hello world";
```

- When initiliased with a string literal, string object lives in the string pool
- Any other string literals declared return the same reference
- Strings that are instatiated have a separate reference in the heap
- Strings are immutable (but can be reassigned normally)

#### Objects:

```java
Object o = new Object();
```

### 1.5 Wrapper Classes

#### Key Notes:

- Each primitive type in Java has a wrapper class when you need object representations
- Each wrapper class has a method to return the primitive value representation (e.g `.intValue()` for `Integer`)
- Wrapper classes can also provide useful utility methods for operating on their primitives (e.g `Integer.parseInt(String)`)
- Some wrapper classes cache values (e.g integer-type wrappers cache values in the range -128 and 127 so they return the same reference)

#### Usage example:

```java
// must use wrapper class in the generic (array lists only allow reference types)
ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
```

#### Value Caching:

- Integer-type wrappers (`Byte`, `Short`, `Integer`, `Long`) cache objects in the value range -128 to 127 so they return the same reference
- `Character` caches character objects in the range 0 to 127
- `Boolean` caches `true` and `false` (same reference returned)
- No caching occures for `Float` and `Double`

#### Autoboxing & Unboxing

- Lets you immediately/automatically convert from a primitive to a wrapper or vice-versa

e.g:

```java
// Autoboxing
Integer num = 5; // int converted to Integer instance

// Unboxing
int value = num; // Integer instance converted to primitive value
```

### 1.6 Class Constructors

#### Default Class Constructors

- If a class doesn't define a constructor, a default is generated by the compiler
- Default class constructors initialise instance variables to their default values and takes no arguments
- It implicitly calls `super()` for the corresponding parent constructor if the class is a sub-class

#### Constructor Chaining

- When a class has an overloaded constructor, it can use `this()` to invoke the corresponding constructor as a shorthand

## 2. Type Casting

### 2.1 Implicit Casting (Widening)

#### Key Points:

- Converting from smaller-size type to larger size-type that results in no data loss and can accomodate it
- When adding characters or numbers with strings, they get upgraded to a string to return a string

#### Valid Casts:

1. **byte → short → int → long → float → double**
2. **char → int → long → float → double**

- Cannot convert from byte or short to char as char is unsigned so data loss would occur due to limited range
- Can convert from long or big int to float because precision loss is not critical (float range contains entire range of longs and ints)

### 2.2 Explicit Casting (Narrowing)

#### Key Points:

- Converting from larger-size type to smaller size-type that results in data loss since it can't accomodate it
- Any data outside the size range gets "chopped off" and then converted by according value

#### Casts:

1. **double → float → long → int → short → byte**
2. **double → float → long → int → char**

### 2.3 Boolean Contexts

- In a boolean context such as an `if` conditional or ternary operator, expression **must** evaluate to a boolean
- In such scenarios, automatic conversion **does not** occur for non-boolean types and throws an error (unlike JS)

## 3. Operators & Keywords

### 3.1 Equality

- `==` and `!=` operators compare primitives by value and objects by reference
- String literals that are equal return the same reference from the string pool
- Comparison can be made with `.equals()` methods that may perform custom implementations
- When doing arithmetic comparison, smaller types are [implicitly casted](#implicit-casting-widening) or "promoted" upwards for accurate comparison

### 3.2 `null`

- `null` indicates the absence of an object reference
- `null` **can only** be assigned to reference types
- `null == null` evaluates to `true`
- `null` gets "cast" to string when concatenating with a string

### 3.3 `switch`

#### Key Points:

- Switch statements are compared by value
- For strings or wrappers, they are compared with `.equals()`
- Case statement values must be **implicitly castable** if primitive otherwise have to be explicitly casted
- Cannot switch on reference types unless `.equals()` method overriden meaningfully

#### Valid expression types that can be switched on:

- **byte, short, int** (and their wrappers)
- **char** (and wrapper)
- **String** (both literal and Object)
- **enum** values

### 3.4 `instanceof`

- `instanceof` returns `true` if the object is an instance of the specified class
- Returns `true` if the object implements the specified interface
- Returns `false` if the object is `null`

### 3.5 XOR

```java
boolean a = true;
boolean b = false;
a ^ b // returns exclusive or (XOR) value
```

## 4. Loops

### 4.1 For-each Loop

#### Key Points:

- Used to iterate over an array or a collection that implements the `Iterable` interface
- The loop variable cannot be modified unless it is a mutable object (throws exception otherwise)

#### Syntax:

```java
for (type element : collection) {
  // code
}
```

## 5. Arrays

### 5.1 About Arrays

- Arrays can only store items of the same type
- Array lengths are fixed and cannot be changed (final field `.length` on the array)
- The array class is a dynamically created runtime class and extends `Object`
- Inherites basic methods such as `.getClass()`, `.equals()`
- Arrays implicitly implement the `Cloneable` and `Serializable` interfaces (allows for cloning and serialization)
- Use the `Arrays` class for more useful static methods that operate on arrays

### 5.2 Creating Arrays

#### Method/Case 1:

- Array values default to the default value of their type (i.e `0` for int, `false` for boolean and `null` for objects)

```java
int[] numbers = new int[5]; // array of size 5: {0, 0, 0, 0, 0}
```

#### Method/Case 2:

```java
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

#### Method/Case 3:

- `new` keyword must be used to intialise anonymous arrays

```java
someMethod(new int[]{1, 4}); // uses new keyword
```

## 6. Functions

### 6.1 Method Overloading

#### Key Points:

- Methods have signatures which is the method name and types/number of parameters
- Methods can be "overloaded" to accept different parameters

#### Example:

```java
// method that gets called depends on the arguments

static int add(int x, int y) {
  return x + y;
}

static double add(double x, double y) {
  return x + y;
}
```

### 6.2 Lambda Expressions

#### Key Points:

- Anonmyous functions typically passed as arguments to methods (like JS arrow functions)
- Lamda expressions can also be returned from methods (as long as there is a matching return type)
- Parameter types don't have to be specified if they can be inferred from the interface
- Can be stored in variables if type is a functional interface (interface with exactly one abstract method)
- Override methods do not count towards the abstract method count in an interface

#### Common Functional Interfaces:

- **Supplier\<T>** (method: get, takes none, returns any)
- **BiFunction\<T, U, R>** (method: apply, takes any 2, returns any)
- **Function\<T, R>** (method: apply, takes any, returns any)
- **Predicate\<T>** (method: test, takes any, returns bool)
- **Consumer\<T>** (method: accept, takes any, returns none)

#### Assigment Example:

```java
Predicate<Integer> greaterThan5 = (x) -> x > 5; // param type inferred from interface
greaterThan5.test(3) // test is the abstract method, returns false
```

### 6.3 Method References

#### Key Points:

- Can be a lambda shorthand since it simply calls a predefined method

#### Types:

1. Reference to static method (`ClassName::staticMethod`)
2. Reference to instance method (`instance::instanceMethod`)
3. Reference to instance method of arbitrary object of particular type (`ClassName::instanceMethod`)
4. Reference to constructor (`ClassName::new`)

#### Examples:

##### Static method:

```java
Function<Double, Double> sqrtRef = Math::sqrt;
// same as (x) -> Math.sqrt(x)
```

##### Instance method:

```java
Consumer<String> printlnRef = System.out::println;
// instance method of PrintStream object System.out
// same as (s) -> System.out.println(s)
```

##### Instance method, arbitrary object:

```java
Function<String, Integer> lengthRef = String::length;
// same as (s) -> s.length()
```

##### Constructor:

```java
Supplier<Object> constructorRef = Object::new;
// same as () -> new Object()
```

## 7. OOP

### 7.1 Inheritance

#### Key Points:

- Allows classes to inherit fields and methods from other classes
- The `extends` keyword allows classes to inherit all methods and properties from its parent class (super class)
- Subclasses must use the `super` keyword in the constructor
- Inheritance represents a unidirectional "is-a" relationship, where if A inerhits/extends B, an A is a B but a B is not an A

#### Example:

```java
class Animal {
  public int legCount;

  public Animal(int legCount) {
    this.legCount = legCount;
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  public Dog() {
    super(2);
  }
}

Dog d = new Dog();
d.legCount; // evaluates to 2, Dog inherits legCount field
```

### 7.2 Encapsulation

#### Key Points:

- Data fields and methods are bundled into a singular class
- Access to fields and methods can be restricted to hide the internal state of the object

#### Example:

```java
class Person {
  private String name;

  public Person(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  public String getName() {
    return this.name;
  }

  public void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

Person p = new Person("Bob");

p.name; // throws exception, name field can only be used internally
p.getName(); // get method provides access, returns "Bob",
p.setName("John"); // set method allows modification, sets p.name to "John",
```

### 7.3 Polymorphism

#### Key Points:

- Allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions
- In simpler terms an interface or method can take on many forms on a need-to basis

#### Compile-time Polymorphism (Static)

- Achieved by method overloading

#### Run-time Polymorphism (Dynamic)

- Achieved by method overriding
- Happens during runtime where the object determines which method to invoke

e.g:

```java
class Animal {
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  @Override
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("Dog barks");
  }
}

Animal dog = new Dog();
Animal a = new Animal();

dog.makeSound(); // "Dog barks", object type is Dog
a.makeSound();  // "Animal makes a sound", object type is Animal
```

### 7.4 Abstraction

#### Key Points:

- Abstraction hides the complex implementation details of the object and only exposes the essential features of the object
- Achieved with **abstract classes** or **interfaces**

#### Abstract Classes

- Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated and are specified with the `abstract` keyword
- They may have both abstract methods (unimplemented) and concrete methods (implemented)
- Abstract methods should be implemented by an adopting class
- If not all abstract methods implemented, then the class **must** be defined with `abstract`

#### Example of abstraction:

```java
abstract class Animal {
  public abstract void makeSound();
}

// class is not abstract since all methods implemented
class Dog extends Animal {
  // method is given concrete implementation
  @Override
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("Dog barks");
  }
}
```

### 7.5 Interfaces

#### Key Points:

- Defines a set of methods as a characteristic that a class can implement
- Abstract methods are implicitly `public` and **cannot** be defined otherwise; only static methods may have other modifiers
- Classes can implement multiple interfaces (comma separation) allowing Java to overcome limitation of single inheritance (a class can only extend one other class)
- Constants in interfaces are implicitly `public`, `static` and `final` but can be defined otherwise (but not instance fields)
- The `@FunctionalInterface` directive can be used to indicate a functional interface you define
- Interfaces can inherit from other interfaces like classes with the `extends` keyword

#### Types of Methods:

- **Abstract** - a method with no body; must be given implementations in a class otherwise the class has to be defined with `abstract`
- **Static** - a method that can be called on the interface itself
- **Default** - a method with a default implementation; can be overriden by the implementing class (declared with the `default` keyword)

### 7.6 Association

#### Types of Association

##### General Association

- One class uses or interacts with another class or knows about it
- Can be unidirectional or bidirectional and one class may depend on another
- General association means the objects have independent lifecycles
- They communicate or interact with each other but there is no ownership

##### Aggregation

- Type of association that is represented by a "has-a" relationship with **loose coupling**
- A class A object can **aggregate** class B objects but if object A is removed, the class B objects can still exist independently (they are significant enough)
- The part can exist independently of the whole

##### Composition

- Type of association that is represented by a "has-a" relationship with **strong coupling** and **ownernship** ("contained-by" relationship)
- The lifetime of the part depends on the whole
- If the whole is deleted, the parts are also deleted
- The part cannot exist independently of the whole

## 8. Packages

### 8.1 About Packages

#### Key Points:

- Groups related classes, interfaces and sub-packages together
- Provides namespacing and access control
- Think of and structure packages like folders (packages create organisation)

#### Syntax:

##### /myPackageName/\*

```java
package myPackageName;

// imports

// class definition
```

##### /myPackageName/subPackage/\*

```java
package myPackageName.subPackage;

// imports

// class definition
```

#### Common Packages:

- `java.lang` - Contains fundamental classes like `String`, `Math`, `Object`, etc. (implicitly imported)
- `java.util` - Contains utility classes like `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, `Date`, etc.
- `java.io` - Contains classes for file input/output operations (`File`, `BufferedReader`, etc.).
- `java.nio` - Provides classes for more efficient I/O operations (New I/O API).
- `java.net` - Contains networking classes like `Socket`, `URL`, etc.
- `java.sql` - Provides classes for working with databases (JDBC).
- `javax.swing` - Contains classes for building GUI applications (e.g., `JFrame`, `JButton`).

### 8.2 Access Modifiers

#### Key Points:

- Used to specify the visibility of methods, variables and constructors (also called members)
- Controls where they can be accessed from
- Top level classes can only specified as public or package-private by default
- Nested classes can be specified with any modifier (since they count as members)

#### Main Modifiers:

##### `public`

- The member can be accessed from any other class, inside or outside the package

##### `protected`

- The member is accessible to all classes within the same package and by all subclasses (even if the class is in a different package)

##### `private`

- The member is only accessible within the same class (or class body)
- Private fields and methods cannot be accessed from any other class including subclasses

##### **Default** (no modifier)

- The member can be accessed from any other class in the package, but not from outside the package
- Is also referred to as "package-private"

#### Summary

- A summary of the level of the access a program has to members of a class with the specified modifier

| Modifier    | Within Class | Same Package | Subclass (Different Package) | Outside Package |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------- | --------------- |
| `public`    | Yes          | Yes          | Yes                          | Yes             |
| `protected` | Yes          | Yes          | Yes                          | No              |
| default     | Yes          | Yes          | No                           | No              |
| `private`   | Yes          | No           | No                           | No              |
